I made another little tool today. I'm trying very hard to streamline some of my work that tends to take up my time and slow down my process. This one is called FlipThisCharacter. At some point, all of these will be included in a much larger tool.

FlipThisCharacter v1.0: A Unified AI Character Workflow Tool
FlipThisCharacter v1.0 is an integrated, two-step web application designed to significantly streamline and accelerate the creation of consistent, high-quality character image assets using the Gemini Image Generation API.

What the Tool Does
This tool automates a crucial, often time-consuming process in creative development: generating a complete set of character images that are visually consistent across various styles, expressions, and presentations.
The workflow is broken into two key steps:
Step 1: Base Image Refinement (The Foundation) You upload an initial character sketch or image. The AI uses your input to create a single, highly refined and detailed master version of your character, applying the chosen visual style (2D, 3D, Hyperrealistic, or NFT Pixel Art). This master image locks in the character's silhouette, pose, lighting, and overall appearance. Crucially, this step also incorporates all your customization settings (background fill, border style, and overlay specifications) onto the master image.

Step 2: Batch Expression Generation (The Set) The application automatically runs a batch job to create 20 new images. For every new image, it uses the refined master image from Step 1 as a reference, ensuring the character remains exactly consistent in pose and framing. It then applies one of the 20 pre-defined expression prompts (Ecstatically Happy, Cutely Furious, etc.) to the character's face. The output retains the exact visual style, background, border, and overlays established in Step 1, delivering a perfectly matched collection.

How It Streamlines Creative Processes
Feature
Creative Usefulness
Guaranteed Consistency
Eliminates the common challenge of visual drift when generating multiple assets. All 20 images share the same core character, lighting, and frame treatment, making them instantly usable in a single project.

Massive Time Savings
Instead of manually crafting and iterating 21 separate prompts (Base + 20 Expressions) and stitching together separate background/border/logo elements, the tool handles all 21 generations with just two clicks.
Rapid Style Prototyping
The ability to switch between 2D, 3D, Hyperrealistic, and NFT Pixel Art with a single dropdown allows creators to rapidly test an entire character set in different visual styles before committing to a final look.

Integrated Branding
The robust customization options allow for immediate application of branding elements (logos, banners, custom colors/borders) directly into the generated image, making the assets ready for marketing or distribution without extra graphic design work.
